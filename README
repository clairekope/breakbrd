## Pickle Files
### Prefixes
cut1 would be the mass > 10**10 Msun cut but it is not saved to file

File Prefix | Cut
------------|----
`cut2_M_r`    | M_r < -19
`parent`      | M_r sans M_* > 10**12 Msun and half mass radius < 2 kpc
`cut3_g-r`    | g-r > 0.655
`cut4`        | "Investigative" cuts; sSFR, radial inversion, or both
`cut_final`   | D4000 < 1.4 for dusty or dustless spectra (inst SFR included)

The `d4000` files contain the D4000 measures for different types of spectra (those with and without dust, and those made with or without the inclusion of the instantaneous star formation rate)

`cut_final.pkl.orig` is used by my (untracked) Jupyter Notebooks to make sure any changes to the `.pkl` files don't change the final dusty D4000 cut.

### Suffixes
